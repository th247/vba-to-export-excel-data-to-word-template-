# vba-to-export-excel-data-to-word-template-
This code adds text from a list in excel to multiple specific areas in a microsoft word document.
The word file name "word_file.docx" is the template and it will be used to create a new word file.
The excel file is where the code is located. First you need to set things up. Under the "address" worksheet, you need to enter the address and name of the word file "word_file.docx" i.e. the template, in the appropriate cells. 
Then if you push the button in the "Sheet1" worksheet, it will generate a new word file based on the list of names provided in "Sheet1"
